# gameoflife

This is a javascript and canvas implementation of [Conway's game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). This code was written as part of a tutorial [on the Hungry Turtle Code channel](https://youtu.be/deXzu0Eregs)

## Other visualisations
There is another branch called "heatmap" where I built upon this code and visualised the game as a heatmap where the value of each cell is built upon the historical life that that cell has had.

## Do something cool
If you do something cool with this please let me know. I would love to see. Open an issue on this repo to show me or contact me [on twitter](https://twitter.com/theproofofsteak)
